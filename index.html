    Bridle is among a host of thinkers who have sought to theorize and advance a more reciprocal way of moving in and relating to the world around us — a view of deep, interspecies kinship previously popularized in the works of Donna Haraway and Octavia Butler. More recent thinkers to pick up these ideas include Adrienne Marie-Brown, whose 2017 book Emergent Strategy urged broadening reciprocity rather than narrowing hierarchy; artist Jenny Odell, whose How to Do Nothing explored the deep power in and urgent need for decommodifying our time and attention; and novel- ist Richard Powers, whose entangled tales of plant and human life trace one interwoven story shared by human and more-than-human agents.

    Recent years have also seen growing popular curiosity about fungi, foraging, birding, meditation, tarot, astrology, witchcraft and a renewed public interest in traditional ecological knowledge.Even the breakout success of an existentialist film like Everything, Everywhere, All at Once, and Ed Yong’s best- selling book An Immense World, which explores the umwelt (or worldview) of nonhuman beings, all suggests a fermenting desire to re-examine our roles and responsibilities to one another, one and all, human or otherwise.

        Perhaps these are the early signs of a wider rejection of the human chauvinism that has brought us to an era defined largely by social despair and ecological collapse. As new space telescopes, genetic tools, and sophisticated algorithms reveal new and exciting perspectives, opportunities and questions, some may simply see an expanding map of frontiers to master and exploit. At what point does our expanding view of the universe inspire humility instead of hubris?

         If there is a perfect obverse to the notion of an eternal human empire among the stars, it might be the simple act of wandering the woods. The task of foraging is not to interrogate or control the environment but to listen and respond to environmental cues. Often, one will find that a hunch or a hint — is that slight crease in a pile of leaves a mushroom? — proves correct, as if a thought were shared with the woods. As ethnographer Ana Tsing writes, “the uncultivated habits of wild mushrooms are good to think with ... wild mushrooms press us into multispecies ecologies in which control may be impossible.”

    In conservation and documentation outings, even academic mycologists will differ from their colleagues in taking their time and, because of the fickle nature of the beings they seek, trusting their intuition. Mycologist Patty Kaishian characterizes these outings as a “timed wander.” <br>

        with which we share them are barely understood by science - millennia of tradition, story and ritual have served as a means of interfacing with them, as Dolores LaChapelle explains in this essay on ritual. And as Bridle notes, the most effective way of charting an unfamiliar space is to explore it randomly, suggesting a kind prosaic, primordial intelligence underlying all things and a wisdom in letting the world do some of our thinking for us.

     If our minds are co-constructed with the world around us, existing in the myriad ways we engage it as much as in the stuff between our ears, this might also cause us to question whether any intelligence can ever be considered artificial. It would seem presumptuous to qualify any intelligence this way when we are still so ignorant of its nature — indeed, fungi too are coming to be recognized as much smarter than science once believed possible. This isn’t news to everybody: Ask a forager or someone with a close or more traditional relationship to their landscape, and you will likely hear an account of the intelligence of fungi, as well as everything else one might encounter among the more than human world. Once the perspective is gleaned through experience, it’s impossible to forget or discount.

    The remediation of my own separation from nature began on a mountaintop in technology’s capital city, when I took mushrooms for the first time atop Mount Davidson (appropriately enough, the highest point in San Francisco). A 100- foot-tall cross towers over its peak, but I was transfixed with the shrubs growing on the periphery. Glowing green in the sunlight, they seemed to regard me in return, as I was overcome with a newfound feeling of fellowship with these leafy Earthlings. Hours passed, and my attention drifted to the distant, pastel-colored row houses of the Sunset District, then to the dusk sky where stars, passing airplanes, and clouds appeared suspended in a crystalline lattice. Like many psychedelic trips, it was a visual delight, but far more impactful was the deep, wordless understanding that myself and everything in sight were part of one majestic, unified whole.

Psychedelic mushrooms are perceived by some as a technology, credited for the growth and complexification of human brains. But our engagement with them is impossible to trace in utilitarian terms — the relationship between human brains and the psilocybin molecule are as emergent and unruly as any other phenomenon in nature. Their mind-altering benefits are really remarkable only for our brains’ ability to remark upon them, and rather than suggesting a world purpose-built to elevate human agency and intelligence, they are a reminder of the utterly contingent nature of our brains and our existence.

As Ana Tsing notes, useful mushrooms gather along the boundaries of human activity and at the “seams of empire.” It might seem that fungi are making a kind of statement as they emerge among the cracks in pavement, at the edges of developments, undermining and offering alternatives to a paved-over world built by and representing a crumbling capitalist order. Of course, mushrooms can’t speak, and even if they could, we might again debate whether this were representative of true intelligence. That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t endeavor to listen. It’s certainly no more absurd than aspiring to lift off and leave Earth behind as a means of preserving human life. While the technologists insist we look to the heavens for signs of hope and means of escape, perhaps the way out of the woods
