    Bridle is among a host of thinkers who have sought to theorize and advance a more reciprocal 
    way of moving in and relating to the world around us â€” a view of deep, interspecies kinship previously popularized in the works 
    of Donna Haraway and Octavia Butler. More recent thinkers to pick up these ideas include Adrienne Marie-Brown, whose 
    2017 book Emergent Strategy urged broadening reciprocity rather than narrowing hierarchy; artist Jenny Odell, whose 
    How to Do Nothing explored the deep power in and urgent need for decommodifying our time and attention; and novel- ist Richard Powers, 
    whose entangled tales of plant and human life trace one interwoven story shared by human and more-than-human agents.
